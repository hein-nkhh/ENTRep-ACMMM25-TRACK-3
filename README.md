# H3N1 at ENTRep-ACMMM25-TRACK-3: KGER: A Knowledge-Grounded Endoscopic Retrieval Framework with a Fused Bi-Encoder and Gemini Re-ranking Pipeline

## ‚ú® Overview

This project presents **KGER (Knowledge-Grounded Endoscopic Retrieval)**, a multi-stage framework designed to tackle the retrieval of endoscopic images in ENT (Ear-Nose-Throat) domain. KGER effectively combines **deep metric learning**, reasoning capabilities of **Large Multimodal Models (LMM)** like Gemini, and a smart score fusion strategy.

The system begins with **10 model NanoCLIP** (Kfold) architecture to quickly retrieve candidate images. Then, an advanced re-ranking phase uses **Gemini** to analyze and reason about the images, overcoming surface-level visual similarity limitations. Finally, the **Pos-Fuse** strategy fuses scores from both stages to ensure results are both visually intuitive and clinically accurate. KGER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ENTRep dataset, bridging semantic gaps and providing a powerful tool for ENT applications.
